# **Collaboration On Github**

---
## Topic One: Version Control (Git)

Version control is a system that manages changes to a file or files.
These changes are kept as logs in a history, with detailed information
on what file(s) was changed, what was changed within the file, who
changed it, and a message on why the change was made.  This is
extremely useful, especially when working in teams or for yourself 6
months in the future (because you *will* forget things)!

To understand how incredibly powerful version control is, think about
these questions: How many files of different versions of a manuscript
or thesis do you have laying around after getting feedback from your
supervisor or co-authors? Have you ever wanted to experiment with your
code or your manuscript and need to make a new file so that the
original is not touched? Have you ever deleted something and wish you
hadn't? Have you ever forgotten what you were doing on a project?  All
these problems are fixed by using version control (git)!

We are going to go over a typical workflow.  This could be either a
solo workflow or a collaborative workflow.

### Checklist: ###

* Configure your git
* Create a folder and create a git repository (`git init`; the saved
  history of the folder and files) in that folder
* Create a file and track it with git (`git add`), saving it to the
  history (`git commit`)
* Write a short bio in the file
* Check what's going on in the folder (`git status`)
* Compare the file with the one in the history (`git diff`)
* Add the tracked file to the 'staging' area (`git add`; this is an
  area *before* going into the history)
* Save the file in the history (`git commit`)
* Look into your history (`git log`)

(If we have time):

* Create a GitHub account and create a repository
* Set the URL of the new GitHub repository to your repository on your
  computer (`git remote`; the command is usually provided from GitHub)
* Upload your repository on your computer (called local repository)
  up to your GitHub repository (called the remote repository; use `git
  push`)
* Download from the remote to the local repository (`git pull`)

**Tips**:

* Make use of TAB-completion in the terminal!
* Up arrow on the terminal goes to the previous command you entered.

### Lesson topics and commands ###

For configuring your git, follow the "Initial setup" I've put
together:

* http://codeasmanuscript.org/lessons/git/cheatsheet/

Create a folder and create a git repository (which is the stored
history) in that folder. (Note: `##` is a comment, not a command).

    cd ~/Desktop ## Move to your desktop
    mkdir playing ## Create a folder (aka directory)
    cd playing
    git init ## Create the repository (init = initialize)

Now, create a file, get git to track it, and save it to the history.

    touch bio.txt ## Command to create a file called bio.txt
    ls ## Check that you created the file, ls = list files
    git add bio.txt ## Track the file
    ## Save the file to the history with a message (-m)
    git commit -m "Initial commit"

Now, open the `bio.txt` file and add:

* Your name
* Your program and year
* Your progamming language/statistical language of choice

Then:

    git status ## Check the activity
    git diff bio.txt ## Compare to the one in the history
    git add bio.txt ## This sends it to the staging area
    git commit -m "Added my bio" ## This sends it to the history

For a description on what the different stages are (working directory,
staging area, and committed history) see the below links:

* Description: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics
* Image: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/book/01-introduction/images/areas.png

Then, to see what has happened in your history:

    git log ## View the log of your history

*If we have time*, we'll create a GitHub account, create a GitHub
repository (a remote repository), and upload the repository on your
computer (called the local repository) onto the remote repository
(GitHub):

    git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/playing.git
    git push origin master
    git pull

Now you know about a typical workflow!  There are **lots** of commands
and options in git, you really can do almost anything.  *However*,
these are the basic tools that are used most frequently.  If you have
any questions, please check out
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/git) for
*literally* any question on or about Git!!  Or just google it! Google
usually shows answers from StackOverflow.

## topic Two: Collaborating on GitHub ##

#### QUESTIONS TO ASK PARTICIPANTS TO GAUGE KNOWLEDGE LEVEL
1. How familiar are you with the unix command line? How often do you work with it?
2. On a scale of 1-5 (1=novice/beginner, 5=expert) what kind of git user are you?  (how often do you use git in your work? once a week, once a day, once a month)
3. Have you used GitHub before?
4. Have you collaborated on a project on GitHub before?

### Git vs GitHub
#### Git
- Git is the command line version control system (VCS) software which works on your local computer.
- Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.
- You need Git to use GitHub. You can use Git locally without GitHub.

#### GitHub
- GitHub is an internet hosting service for git repositories. Public repos are free; private repos are paid.
- As a shared space for repos, it allows you to do collaborative work.


### Two Common Collaborative Work Flows
#### Shared Repository Model
- For small projects where you are basically in the same physical space (e.g. lab with offices near each other).
- Be careful! You are cloning the main repository.
- Everyone has push and pull access to the central repo, so be careful and:
  - Never commit to the master directly.
  - Always do your work on a different branch from master.

#### Basic Shared Repository Workflow
- update your local repo with `git pull origin master`,
- create a working branch with `git checkout -b MyNewBranch`
- make your changes on your branch and stage them with `git add`,
- commit your changes locally with `git commit -m "description of your commit"`, and
- upload the changes (including your new branch) to GitHub with `git push origin MyNewBranch`
- Go to the main repo on GitHub where you should now see your new branch
- click on your branch name
- click on "Pull Request" button (URC)
- click on "Send Pull Request"


#### Fork and Pull Model
- This is the model used by U of T Coders on its own website and repos.
- The "owner"/"Project Leader" of the upstream repo assigns rights to "Collaborators"
- Collaborators do not have push access to main (upstream) repo
- Project Lead accepts Pull Requests (PRs) from collaborators, reviews them, then merges them into main repo.


#### Fork and Pull Workflow  
- to be demonstrated during lesson


### Some Git Terminology/Jargon
#### Repos and Branches

Term | Description
----- | ------------
Origin (repo) | Your remote repo (on Github); it is the "origin" for your local copy. Either it is a repo you created yourself or it is a fork of someone else's GitHub repo.
Upstream (repo)| The main repo (on GitHub) from which you forked your GiHub repo.
Local (repo) | The repo on your local computer.
Master | The main branch (version) of your repo.


#### Basic Commands/Actions

Term | Explanation
---| ---
Fork | Make a copy of someone else's GitHub repo in your own GitHub account.
Clone | Make a copy of the your GitHub repo on your local computer.  In CLI: 'git clone' copies a remote repo to create a local repo with a remote called `origin` automatically set up.
Pull | You incorporate changes into your repo.
Add | Adding snapshots of your changes to the "Staging"  area.
Commit | Takes the files as they are in your staging area and stores a snap shot of your files (changes) permanently in your Git directory.
Push | You "push" your files (changes) to the remote repo.
Merge | Incorporate changes into the branch you are on.
Pull Request | Term used in collaboration. You "issue a pull request" to the owner of the upstream repo asking them to pull your changes into their repo (accept your work).



### Configuring git global settings on your local computer
You only have to do this once; global settings apply to all your git repos.  
Note: Any Local settings you initiate within individual git repositories will over ride global settings.  
- username
- email
- display colours
- preferred text editor


Command line git syntax is: ```git verb```

>```$ git config --global user.name "Albert Einstein"```  
>```$ git config --global user.email   "bertie@worlduniversity.edu"```  
>```$ git config --global color.ui "auto"```  

Use your own name and email address instead of Einstein's. This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity, which means that any changes pushed to a Git host server will include this information.

For this lesson, we will be interacting with GitHub and so the email address used should be the same as the one used when setting up your GitHub account. If you are concerned about privacy, please review GitHubâ€™s instructions for keeping your email address private. If you elect to use a private email address with GitHub, then use that same email address for the ```user.email``` value, e.g. ```username@users.noreply.github.com``` replacing ```username``` with your GitHub one. You can change the email address later on by using the ```git config``` command again.

Set up your favorite text editor (default editor):

>```$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"```  
>```$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"```  

See https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/ for settings for other text editors

------------------------------------------------------
## Exercise 1
### Two Person Collaboration via the CLI - Shared Repo Workflow (without branches)
This exercise is based on the SWC Git Novice lesson https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/08-collab/

One of you will be the "Owner" and one of you will be the "Collaborator."

#### A. Owner gives collaborator access to their repo.
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Add a file called "tenlines.txt" and put the text from the etherpad into the file. Commit your changes.
2. Click on **Settings** tab.
3. Click **Collaborators**
4. Enter collaborataors username

#### B. Collaborator clones Owner's Repo
1. Go to https://github.com/notifications and accept access to Owner's repo.
2. On the CLI, clone the owner's repo but issuing the commmand:  
```$ git clone URL-of-Origin-Repo Directory-Address-of-Local-Repo```  

#### C. Collaborator works on clone of Owner's Repo
Go to your cloned repo:  
```$ cd ~/.../yourClone```  

Open editor and revise working file:   
```atom tenlines.txt```  

Commit your changes to your local repo:  
```$ git add tenlines.txt```  
```$ git commit -m "your commit message"```  

Push your changes to the Owner's repo on GitHub:  
```$ git push origin master```  

#### D. Owner review and accepts changes from Collaborator
Look at Owner's GitHub repo and see new commit(s) from Collaborator.  

Download (pull) Collaborators changes to Owner's local repo:  
```$ git pull origin master```  

---------------------------------  
## Exercise 2
### Dealing with Merge Conflicts
This section is based on the SWC Git Novice lesson https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/09-conflict/  

When two or more people work on the same files, conflicts are bound to occur. Version control will help notify us when there are conflicts. It will be up to the humans to sort out which changes to retain.  

The file "tenlines.txt" currently looks like this:  
```$ cat tenlinestxt```  

Let's say **Person A** adds a line to the file and review:  
```$ atom tenlines.txt```  
```$ cat tenlines.txt```  

and pushes changes to GitHub:  
```$ git add tenlines.txt```  
```$ git commit -m "added a line in local copy and pushed to remote"```  
```$ git push origin master```  

Now, **Person B** modifies her local file without first updating it (pulling the repo) from GitHub:  
Add a line to the file and review:  
```$ atom tenlines.txt```  
```$ cat tenlines.txt```  

Commit the changes locally:  
```$ git add tenlines.txt```  
```$ git commit -m "added a line in local copy"```  

But when we push, Git will not allow this because there were changes to the same line in the two files:  
```$ git push origin master```  

To resolve the conflict, you need to **pull** the changes from GitHub, **merge** them into your local copy, and then **push** it back to GitHub  
```$ git pull origin master```  

Git tells us there is a conflict and tells you the file it's in.  
Let's look at the file:  
```cat tenlines.txt```  

Git has put some new info in our file:  

```<<<<<<<<<<<<< HEAD```  
```our text```  
```========```  
```Other persons's text```  
```>>>>>>>>```  

You need to open your text editor and make the changes which is the accepted version by you and your collaborator:  
```atom tenfiles.txt```  

Then, to finish mergining, you need to **add**, **commit**, and **push** your changes back to GitHub:  
```$ git add tenlines.txt```  

You can verify the status of your repo first, then commit and push:  
```$ git status```  
```$ git commit -m "Merged changes from GitHub"```  
```$ git push origin master```

Git keeps track that a conflict has been resolved and what was merged into what so when Person A who made the first changes pulls from GitHub, she doesn't have to fix things and merge again.  

Person A pull and sees new version of the file:  
```$ git pull origina master```  
```$ cat tenlines.txt```  

---------------------------------
