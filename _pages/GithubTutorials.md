# **GitHub for Collaboration On Open Projects**

---

Get comfortable with a Collaborative workflow in the GitHub interface. Practice adding resources to your repo, working with issues and lables, forking and branching, writing commit messages, making and reviewing pull requests, and merging changes. You'll also practice good communication with contributors.

- **Duration:** 45 to 60 minutes
- **Level:** Intermediate

---

### **Guidelines**

1. **Forma:** This is designed as a in-person, facilitated workshop with pairs of learners working together on each other's repositories. It could also be done online. 

2. **Target Audience:** Project Leads and Contributors 

3. **Materials**
   - Two people with projects already hosted on GitHub
   - Computers to work on
   - An Internet connection to access the GitHub site

### **Introduction**

 GitHub is a web-based interface for version control, a way of keeping track of changes made to a collection of working documents. GitHub provides a structure and space for communicating about collaborative work on open projects. With bit of set-up, and a good workflow, you can make your project accessible and transparent, and create a respectful and productive working environment for your collaborators.

 This exercise walks you through a workflow for collaboration on open projects, and demonstrates good communication with contributors. You'll need a partner for this exercise. And you'll each play two roles: you'll act as "project lead" on your own project, and "contributor" on your partner's project, as desginated in the steps below.

 Before you start, provide your partner with a link to your repository. Your repo should look something like this (with your own content, of course).

### **Steps to Complete**

1. **Add Files**
   - As project lead: add any new files you've created to your repo (readme.md, roadmap.md, contributing.md). Give the file a name, and the .md extension so you can use markdown for formatting. 

2. **Make a Label**
   - As project lead: Make a new label. Click the "Issues" tab, then look for the labels tab, just to the right of the "filter" box. Add a label called "good first bugs." 

3. **Make An Issue**
   - As project lead: create an issue in your own repo to document a "good first bug". A good first bug is something simple that a new contributor can work on, to try out contribution and get comfortable with the workflow. It's work that's useful to the project but relatively easy... not so difficult as to be overwhelming or discouraging for someone new to your project. An example of a good first bug for this exercise: fix a typo in the readme, add a badge, add a science fox, etc. 

4. **Comment On An Issue**
   - As contributor: Go to your partner's repo, find the "Good First Bug" issue. (Click on the issue button to see all the issues.)
