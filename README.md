# Wang Research Group Website

Wang Research Group is based at the School of Natural Science in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Tougaloo College.

This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. We tried to make it simple yet adaptable, so that it is easy for you to use it as a template. Plese feel free to copy and modify for your own purposes.

Thanks to the [Allan Lab](http://www.allanlab.org/) for providing the basis for this site. Source available [here](https://github.com/mpa139/allanlab).
